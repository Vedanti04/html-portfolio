<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO VEDU</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All Time..!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>HARRY POTTER</h3>
<p>
  It’s been many years since the first Harry Potter movie—Harry Potter and the
  Sorcerer’s Stone—<br />made its way to theaters. Harry Potter went through a
  lot with his two best friends, Ron Weasley<br />
  and Hermione Granger. There was adventure, heartbreak, and even death—all the
  elements that<br />
  shaped Harry into the man he needed to be to face the dark and evil wizard
  Lord Voldemort.

<p>
  We all know the classic battle of book vs. movie, of which one is better and
  how the books have<br />
  more details, but although I’ve read the books religiously since they came
  out, I will stick to the<br />
  movie franchise. I will give a brief summary of the events that transpire in
  each of the movies.

<h3>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p>
  Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani is the story of the relationship between two
  characters, Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor) &<br />
  Naina (Deepika Padukone), at two separate but defining times in their lives...
  first, when they are just out of<br />
  college and standing on the crossroads of multiple decisions that will shape
  who and what they become...<br />
  and then later on, in their late-twenties when they meet again, holding on to
  certain fulfilled and certain<br />
  unfulfilled dreams, at a crossroads of another nature this time... how these
  two characters affect, change,<br />
  befriend and eventually fall in love with each other is the journey the film
  aspires to take us on..

<h3>3 IDIOTS</h3>
<p>
  Two friends are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their
  college days and recall the<br />
  memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the
  rest of the world called them <br />"idiots".
